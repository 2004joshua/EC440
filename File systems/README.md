External Resources

* Stack Overflow: Used for troubleshooting and understanding various concepts related to file systems and C programming.
* Textbook & Class Slides: Provided the structure setups and theoretical foundation for file system implementation.
* OSDev: Offered insights into the practical aspects of developing a file system.
* Man Pages: Used to understand the original functions and their expected behavior in a Unix-like environment.

Notes: 
* I tried to go for the extra credit by using the double indirect but I had problems implementing the single and thats what costed me
  the last 5 points on this assignment, If i have time at the end of the semester ill finish it
* I know how to get the last point on this assignment, all you do is compress the blocks so you can fit it within the 8192 blocks we were given
